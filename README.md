I'm leaving it as is for now. I've had completely burn out of this project long time ago.
Part of 2022 and entirety of this year (till this moment) i dedicated solely to this project.. Just to realize how useless and dumb it was to the point not as single person bought a subscription, which was honestly, pretty cheap (5$/Month).

Thanks to nobody who had faith in this. 

With that being said, i've left minecraft community at long last, 'cause this mod have been last thing connecting myself and 2b2t/Minecraft community for these years. 
It drained most of my energy and passion to anything during these 2 years.

Now, as im releasing this, have fun pasting, just make sure to credit me somewhere.
